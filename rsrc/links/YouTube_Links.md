  - Aliasing!! : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uENITui5_jU Water cannot flow upwards ... the frame rate of the recording is just too low to capture the "correct" vibration. A similar phenomenon applies to sound: you've got to choose an appropriate sample rate to reproduce frequencies up to the hearing limit (for humans, this is in the range of 20 kHz).
